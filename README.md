## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my progress and experiments as a junior Android developer learning the fundamentals of building mobile applications. This space is dedicated to understanding core Android concepts, particularly the app lifecycle and activity navigationâ€”both essential building blocks for creating stable, user-friendly apps.

As I continue growing my skills in Android development, my focus is on mastering how activities and fragments interact, how state is preserved across configuration changes, and how to handle navigation in a smooth, predictable way. Understanding the lifecycle of an Android app is key to managing resources effectively, avoiding memory leaks, and providing a responsive user experience.

In this repository, you'll find small, focused projects and sample apps that explore key areas such as activity stack behavior, fragment transactions, intent passing, back stack handling, and lifecycle-aware components. Iâ€™m using Android Studio and working primarily in Kotlin, while also experimenting with Jetpack libraries like Navigation Component and Lifecycle.

Each project includes comments, diagrams, and brief documentation to explain what I'm learning and why it matters. My goal is not just to make things work, but to build a strong foundation in Android architecture and navigation patterns that scale with app complexity.

This repository is a reflection of my journey as a learner and builder. If you're also new to Android development or revisiting these foundational topics, I hope you find some of these examples useful or relatable.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcomeâ€”especially from experienced developers willing to share their insights. Iâ€™m excited to keep exploring the Android ecosystem and to continue improving with each project.
